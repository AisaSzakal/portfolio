            <p>In the "Pizzeria Project",  my team called Judis had to think about a way of rebuilding an old-fashioned
                 restaurant's ordering and baking method while keeping the authentic Italian style.
                At the end of the project we could build two websites (one for the employees and one for the customers) 
                which were connected, and to make it even more efficient we connected our smart oven prototype to the employee's website. 
                In the end with our help, the Pizzeria could work quicker, and with user research, user interviews, 
                and much work we could build a simple but well-working website for the customers.
                
                <br><br><span class="small-title"> My part:</span><br>
                I was working with one of my teammates focusing primarly on the website development, and prototypes. 
                We had to think about the optimal layouts, color schemes, and functionality to enhance user experience. 
                I took charge of designing the logo for the website. In the final stages, I played a pivotal role in constructing 
                the presentation to showcase our collective work effectively."<br>

                <span class="small-title1"> Technical skills that I gained:</span><br><br>
                Before the Pizzeria project, I had to explore Python, HTML, and CSS, so
                I could be a help for the group. However, my learning did not stop there, since throughout the 
                project I had to look after a lot of information on how to solve the problems that I was faced with,
                and the methods with which I could build something digitally.
                <br>I feel like in the end, it was worth it, 
                since not just the project went well, but I also started to enjoy the process of these types of work.<br>
                </p>

            <p><span class="small-title1"> Professional skills:</span><br><br>
                Navigating my first significant group project was occasionally overwhelming, given my limited prior experience. 
                However, I truly appreciated my group, and with them, I could learn, not just a way of sharing 
                tasks but also about myself and my way of thinking.
                In the end, we could build up as a team, and solve the task efficiently. 
                Personally, I got better and better at expressing my thoughts, actively listen, 
                and,  crucially, let go of ideas when necessary.<br><br>

                <span class="small-title">Future-oriented organization:</span><br>
                I feel like I have never had a problem with arranging my time and my tasks, 
                working on group projects showed me a different side of time management.
                <br>Collaborating with a team required us to plan together, set quality expectations, 
                and consider how our choices affected people and organizations.<br>
                I realized that too much structure can stifle creativity. So, even though planning is important, 
                I learned to leave room for flexibility.
                <br>That's why I find tools like the MoSCoW plan helpful â€“ 
                they add a dynamic element to our planning.<br>
                In a nutshell, I've learned that balancing structure with flexibility is crucial for successful teamwork,
                 making projects more effective and enjoyable."
