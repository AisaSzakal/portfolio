            <p>The Ordinary Minds had the mission of creating a website that can help university students.
                <br>Our vision was to help students solve the daily challenges students face,
                like providing solutions for simple and affordable recipes, fostering friendships, identifying suitable communities, 
                and managing a budget, all within a single platform.
                To make it functional we had to carried out a lot of research, but in the end, if we 
                could lightening the load on students' shoulders, I believe the effort was truly worthwhile.
                <br><br><span class="small-title"> My part:</span><br>
                Aside the designs, ideas, research and planning part that we worked on together, I mainly focused on the social 
                page for the website.<br>

                <span class="small-title"> Trends and developments:</span><br>
                When we began with the implementation I did not start from nothing I initially had a general knowledge of 
                working with HTML and CSS, but I also wanted to learn more about it. Recognizing, that JavaScript can be a nice touch in a
                 website, I dedicated time to learning its basics as well. Moreover, during the coding process, artificial intelligence (AI) played an important role in aiding my learning journey. 
                 AI tools and resources provided assistance in understanding complex concepts, debugging code, and exploring solutions.<br> My newfound knowledge allowed me to implement dynamic elements 
                 like slideshows and navigation bars, proving to be a valuable skill set, especially by the conclusion of our second group project. <br>

                <span class="small-title"> Target group:</span><br>
                In this group project, we did not have any specific information or data about our project itself. 
                To address this extensive research became our initial focus, to learn more
                about the needs and interests of the end user. We conducted several interviews, surveys, and tests (mainly with students), to identify key areas of importance 
                and what aspects to prioritize and what to leave behind. 
                After the pizzeria project, I had gained some insights into conducting interviews, but in this project I still could improve the skill of fast thinking. 
                We engaged in the task of synthesizing the gathered data, pinpointing the primary challenges faced by students—centered around cooking, 
                socializing in a new environment, and managing a budget. This phase proved crucial in shaping our developmental process to align with the
                 genuine needs of the end users.<br>

                <span class="small-title"> Iterative process and interactive prototypes:</span><br>
                After working with the research, and summaries, we  we transitioned from research to envisioning our website's design and functionality. 
                Collaborating with fellow students, we tested prototypes (over and over again) to refine the product based on user needs. 
                We started with a paper prototype, which we advanced to an interactive Figma version about the layout, and just after that, we started with the colors, fonts, and design elements. 
                In this phase, we continuously integrated feedback into our process.
                This long process ensured our design, to implement it nicely in HTML and CSS. SO in the end our website not only met user needs but also received aesthetic validation. 
                The experience emphasized how considering everyone's needs and focusing on user-friendly design is crucial in making digital products that work well for people (students) interacting with machines.<br>

            <span class="small-title">Investigative problem solving:</span><br>
            Different eyes see different things, I find it beneficial because collective input sharpens the project's focus on details.
            I've realized that not everyone shares my approach, and some may need more guidance to express their ideas. To address this, 
            I've learned how to foster effective communicationto, and to ask the right questions from both the target group and from the people I work with.
            Pitching ideas multiple times helped us to learn about expressing ourselves.
            Clear communication within the team is crucial, so we established agreements to maintain a positive atmosphere during meetings (see attached document).
             Additionally, conducting spontaneous interviews enhanced our adaptability, 
             requiring us to formulate questions on the spot. This experience has taught me the importance of curiosity, 
             adapting my approach based on the pragmatic and critical needs of the situation.<br>

            <span class="small-title"> Personal leadership:</span><br>
            When I first entered R10 I did not have much experience with coding and most of the ICT related studies.
            therefore I did not need much time to realize I quickly realized the importance of not just acquiring technical skills
             but also developing a strategic approach to learning these programs effectively.  After my first group project I came to the conclusion that 
            I am capable of many more things that I think. 
            The real challenge came in the second project, where teamwork was not so fluent. Facing the challenges showed me how important motivation is for success.
            Getting feedback wasn't just about asking teachers; it was about open communication with peers. This taught me the value of recognizing what 
            I needed to learn and being open to constructive criticism.
            In short, now, I look for opportunities, work with purpose, make smart study choices,
             and embrace feedback for continuous learning.
            <br><br>
            <span class="small-title"> Targeted interaction:</span><br>
            In this project, we had to think just like a student, since our target was university students.  While relating to the audience came naturally, 
            we sought to enhance our understanding through various research tests. During this phase one of the key factors was the communication, since
            we aimed to make the target group understand what our goal are, but on the other hand to have benefical tests we should not manipulate the participants to say
            what we wanted to hear.
            During the first group project, a designated leader managed the group dynamics, allowing me to focus primarily on my individual tasks.
             However, the dynamic shifted in the second group project, where everyone had to be mindful not only of their own responsibilities 
             but also of others' contributions.
             This experience emphasized the diversity within our team—some members thrived with more guidance, while others preferred working independently. 
             Recognizing and adapting to these varied working styles became essential so to have a great communication betweeen us, and with the teachers. 
            All in all, I've gained valuable insights into understanding people's approaches to work,
              and I am confident that I can now quickly assess and adapt to different working styles in the future, contributing to more effective collaboration.<br>
